	<h1>Patch notes: R1P2</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Former versions introduced changes to <span class="path">Engine/source/gfx/primBuilder.cpp</span>.
		Those changes are no longer required; you can revert that file using your VCS software, or by fetching the file
		<a href="https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/blob/master/Engine/source/gfx/primBuilder.cpp">from GitHub</a>.</li>
		<li>Support for large NavMeshes is officially here! I recommend building them with the nav console open.
		Some pre-release screenshots have featured a 'time remaining' field in the console; this was removed due to it being completely inaccurate.
		It will return in future versions!</li>
		<li>Rendering performance when there is a large NavMesh is pretty poor.
		I recommend unchecking the 'mesh' tickbox at the top of the nav editor if you have a very large NavMesh in the scene.
		Just check it on when you need to see the mesh.</li>
		<li>Rendering performance of a tile's voxels is even worse. Please don't do it.</li>
		<li>The NavMesh member <span class="code">maxTiles</span> has been removed in favor of calculating this value automatically when a build happens.
		No more finding out that you didn't set it high enough and some of your mesh didn't build!</li>
