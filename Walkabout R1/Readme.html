	<p style="text-align:center;">Welcome to the <strong>Walkabout navigation toolkit</strong>!
	Use the links above to view the documentation files, or go to the discussion forums to get help.
	Thanks for choosing <strong>Walkabout</strong>.
	It's been a long road to bring the kit this far, but I sincerely hope you are satisfied with it, and
	wish you the best of luck with all your projects!</p>

	<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
	<p>This product derives many of its features from the Recast library, a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/recastnavigation/">freely-available</a> open-source navmesh generation library.
	This library was not written by me, and it is freely available for anyone to use.
	I'd like to make it very clear that I am hugely indebted to Mikko Mononen, the author of Recast, both for his work and for allowing me to sell this product.</p>

	<p>What you are purchasing is not his code, but the specific features that I have added to Torque 3D to make his code work with it.
	This has involved a great deal of adaptation, creating an entire editor plugin, and writing documentation and tutorials - and, of course,
	will include providing support and updates well into the future.</p>

	<p>A less fully-featured integration of Recast with T3D is freely available <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/community/blogs/view/21392">here</a>.
	<strong>Walkabout</strong> shares its fundamental design with the Recast Resource, but includes additional features
	(some available in the Recast library already, some of my own design) and much a much more user-friendly experience.
	Note: the Recast Resource makes use of <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/community/blogs/view/21132">Lethal Concepts' Recast meshloader resource</a> to parse geometry.
	That code has been replaced in this product.</p>

	<p>I'd like to say a heartfelt thank-you to my testers, and in particular,
	Twisted Jenius of the <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/products/ai-starter-kit">Universal AI Starter Kit</a>.
	You were all a great help, and <strong>Walkabout</strong> wouldn't have been released in the state it is without your feedback.
	I'd also like to shout out to Andy Rollins, who first introduced me to navmeshes.</p>
