	<p style="text-align:center;">Thanks for choosing the <strong>Walkabout Navigation Toolkit</strong>!
	Please read the EULA below before installing or using the kit.
	Use the links above to view the documentation files, or go to the discussion forums to get help.
	It's been a long road to bring the kit this far, but I sincerely hope you are satisfied with it, and
	wish you the best of luck with all your projects!</p>

	<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
	<p>This product derives many of its features from the Recast library, a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/recastnavigation/">freely-available</a> open-source navmesh generation library.
	This library was not written by me, and it is freely available for anyone to use.
	I'd like to make it very clear that I am hugely indebted to Mikko Mononen, the author of Recast, both for his work and for allowing me to sell this product.</p>

	<p>What you are purchasing is not his code, but the specific features that I have added to Torque 3D to make his code work with it.
	This has involved a great deal of adaptation, creating an entire editor plugin, and writing documentation and tutorials - and, of course,
	will include providing support and updates well into the future.</p>

	<p>A less fully-featured integration of Recast with T3D is freely available <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/community/blogs/view/21392">here</a>.
	<strong>Walkabout</strong> shares its fundamental design with the Recast Resource, but includes additional features
	(some available in the Recast library already, some of my own design) and much a much more user-friendly experience.
	Note: the Recast Resource makes use of <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/community/blogs/view/21132">Lethal Concepts' Recast meshloader resource</a> to parse geometry.
	That code has been replaced in this product.</p>

	<p>I'd like to say a heartfelt thank-you to my testers, and in particular,
	Twisted Jenius of the <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/products/ai-starter-kit">Universal AI Starter Kit</a>.
	You were all a great help, and <strong>Walkabout</strong> wouldn't have been released in the state it is without your feedback.
	I'd also like to shout out to Andy Rollins, who first introduced me to navmeshes.</p>
