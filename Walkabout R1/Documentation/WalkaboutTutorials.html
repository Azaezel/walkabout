	<h1 id="basics">The Basics</h1>
	<p>This tutorial will take you through the very basics of using <strong>Walkabout.</strong>
	You'll learn how to add a NavMesh to a mission, build it, and test it with some AIPlayers.
	It goes hand-in-hand with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5bKGLCmQLI">this video tutorial</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="basics-newmission">Creating a new mission</h2>
	<p>When you run Torque3D, you will be presented with the main menu.
	Instead of opening an existing level, we'll create a new one by pressing F11 and selecting 'Blank Room' as the template.</p>
	<img src="images/basics/newmission.jpg" alt="Choosing a template for the new mission." />
	<p>When the new mission has loaded, the World Editor should open up straight away.
	Hit F5 (or select the orange cube in the editor mode strip) to enter the Skech tool.
	We'll use the Sketch tool to create some random geometry for our characters to navigate.
	Hold the Alt key, click and drag your mouse to create a shape on the ground, then move the mouse vertically to give it height.
	Try making some large obstacles, and maybe even a ramp up onto one of them, like so:</p>

	<h2 id="basics-navmesh">Creating a NavMesh</h2>
	<p>Let's create our first NavMesh!
	Open the NavEditor by selecting the <strong>Walkabout</strong> logo from the editor mode strip.
	Since there is no NavMesh in your mission already, you'll be prompted to create one.
	Check the box marked 'fit NavMesh to mission area' (as below) and hit 'Create'.</p>
	<img src="images/basics/dialog.jpg." alt="Using the NavMesh creation dialog." />
	<p>The 'fit to mission' checkbox automatically scales the NavMesh to the size of the objects in your mission, (not including Terrains).</p>
	
	<h2 id="basics-buildmesh">Building the NavMesh</h2>
	<p>When the NavMesh is created, you will be put into the Nav editor's <i>inspect mode</i>.
	Here you can tweak the settings of your NavMesh, which you can see selected in the tree view to the right.
	You can see the NavMesh represented as a blue box around your Convex geometry, but there's no actual mesh yet - let's make one now!
	On the right, find the 'build NavMesh' button and press it. You should see your NavMesh turn red as tiles are added to it.
	Once it's finished building, it will turn blue again, and you should have something like this:</p>
	<img src="images/basics/navmesh.jpg" alt="The built NavMesh." />
	
	<h2 id="basics-testing">Testing the NavMesh</h2>
	<p>Now we're ready to test the NavMesh we just created!
	To go into <i>test mode</i>, select the small person icon on the left, or press 5.
	To spawn a new AIPlayer, hold Ctrl and click somewhere on the level, or aim your camera at the location you want and hit the 'spawn' button on the right.
	The character you've just created will be selected - move it around by clicking somewhere in the level, and watch as your character finds a path.</p>

	<p>Congratulations! You've created and tested your first NavMesh!</p>
